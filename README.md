Multimedia Elements

Images (Bitmaps)
All photos used in the project are original photographs taken by me. They were edited in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom (color correction, lighting adjustment, contrast and cropping).

Logo (Vector Graphic)
The website logo (logo.svg) was created by me as an SVG vector file to ensure scalability and proper web optimization.

Video
The promotional video (promo.mp4) was edited by me and includes audio, basic transitions, and structured sections.

Technical Details

The website consists of multiple pages (Home, Services, Projects, Pricing, About, Contact).
It was built using HTML, CSS and JS.
A custom image slider is implemented on the Projects page.
The layout is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
